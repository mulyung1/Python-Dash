YOUR VIRUAL ENVIRONMENT
within the windows powershell, run the commands below. 


PS> mkdir avocado_analytics
PS> cd avocado_analytics
PS> python -m venv venv
PS> venv\Scripts\activate

The first two commands create your project's directory and move your current location there. 
the last two commands create your new virtual python environment and activate it in Windows.

Ensure you have saved the avocado.csv and app.py files in the root directory of your project.
